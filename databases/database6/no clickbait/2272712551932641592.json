It was a surprise and one of the most incredible things I\u2019ve seen! @vadster on top of having her own wedding (which was three to four days full of festivities) planned an amazing trip afterwards for us. Instead of a honeymoon, she chose a \u201cfriend\u201d moon. I\u2019m not sure how many people would choose to do that but it shows you how special she is, along with Parth. Thank you for the opportunity and treating us like family \u2764\ufe0f It\u2019s crazy how we almost didn\u2019t go, due to the Coronavirus. Our first flights got cancelled and we weren\u2019t sure about traveling. we made it back \u201cjust in time.\u201d I miss traveling and seeing friends and family. Hoping the world can heal soon! Stay safe everyone. \nVirtual hugs and dances \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffd Join @rumbao_ldc for online classes!\n\n#tajmahal #india #worldwonder #travels #dancer #rumbao #charlottenc"
