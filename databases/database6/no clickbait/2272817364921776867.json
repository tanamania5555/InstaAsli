I don\u2019t know why but I kind of attribute it back to with the 35W bridge collapsed years ago and that bridge is VERY familiar to me and drive across it often (while having minor panic attacks). Anyways, 6 years ago in New Zealand in the South Island I had to opportunity to bungee jump and decided I did NOT want to do it. After watching people I was traveling with sign up, I on a whim handed my credit card over and decided to bungee with @ajhackettbungynz \nI ended up diving off (I\u2019ll post a video later) and it was such a liberating, freeing experience. And honestly, really helped with my fear of bridges haha! I\u2019m sooooo happy I bought that ticket on a whim and desperately want to bungee again soon! \nLove you, New Zealand \ud83d\ude18\n\n#travel #travelphotography #travelblogger #travelgram #traveltheworld #travelholic #traveling #travelnz #solotravel #solotraveler #solotravels #solofemaletraveler #solofemaletravel #femaletraveler #femaletravelbloggers #newzealand #newzealandtravel #newzealandroadtrip #beach  #dametraveler #dametravelers #wanderlust #wander #wanderlusting #kawaraubridge #bungeejumping #bungee #adventure #kawaraubridgebungy #adventurousstorytellers"
