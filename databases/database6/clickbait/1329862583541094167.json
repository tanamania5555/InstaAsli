It's open to anyone of you lovely people anywhere in the world and it's not just one top prize we can all win the \u00a31500 or whatever we go for if we want to. I see a group trip coming on and lots of fun! \nThe qualification period starts today, you might only need 2 weeks but they are giving us 3 months. Work with me in some of your spare time to win either of these or many more prizes like MacBook Airs, spa experiences, trips to Spain, high spec TV, a personal shopping experience with spends at Selfridges.....the list goes on. Three different levels to qualify and choices of prizes at each level! So exciting. I'm going to get the \u00a31500, that's what I'm after. Which would you like? \nGet in touch, comment or pm me for more info and let's do this together. \n#freeholiday #freetriptonewyork #freetravel #incentives #freetv #freemacbook #freespatrip #win #qualify #workwithme #letsdothis #together #funtimes #exciting"
